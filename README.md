### Steps on how to create Github page:
1. On your own repository, go to the **Settings** Tab.
2. Then, find and go to the **Pages**.
3. Select **Deploy from branch** and select **/root** folder then  **Save**.
4. Wait until your pages is finally publish, and you're now good to go.
5. Your website should have a url of **<github-username>.github.io/<repository-name>.

### What are your key takeaways from this exercise?
> This exercise is a lot trickier than I imagined since we will only have to deal with HTML and CSS. Instead, it became more challenging when exploring the flexbox and how you will utilize it on your own site to make it more visually appealing while maintaining the cohesiveness of the user experience and interface.
